# Game Of Life 

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway in 1970.

It's also used for [Coderetreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/). I participated in Coderetreat 1 time at work. We organized it for our development team. I wanted to implement this game with visualization and write tests for it.
